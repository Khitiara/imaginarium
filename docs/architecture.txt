- shared memory MP
- absolutely using TPR as an IRQL type thing
- usermode kernel services dynamic library always loaded
- binary logging ala journald
- threads are first-class objects and may be supervisor or user threads
    - supervisor threads run in supervisor mode and are created by and used for background kernel functions
    - user threads are created, owned, and used by user-mode processes
    - each thread has a desired privelage level and its own page mappings, much of which overlaps with process and
        kernel memory mappings
    - threads may register waits on kernel objects, eg for IO operations or synchronization
    - threads may be suspended or resumed by other threads
- processes always have at least one thread
