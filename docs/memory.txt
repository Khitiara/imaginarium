- bottom 4 pages identity-mapped
- proc-local state in gs
- kernel-mode pages global?
- higher half kernel

- kernel and usermode kernel services always mapped
- per-process page tables, maybe use PCID?
- both direct-page and a managed heap allocator exposed to user processes through usermode kernel services

stage1 loaded at base 0xffff_ffff_8000_0000
stage2 loaded at base 0xffff_f000_0000_0000

page tables, gdt, idt, tss etc loaded within the stage1 area

physical memory mapped to 0xffff_e000_0000_0000 thru 0xffff_efff_ffff_ffff
