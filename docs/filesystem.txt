file paths are paths (see objects.txt) whose first segment is `/!`, `/:`, or `/*`
a file system entry may be:
  - a regular file
  - a directory
  - a symbolic link to another entry
  - a mount point with a UUID
      - mount point UUID is used to load a symbolic link from a config file in the root FS
      - e.g. if `/!/code/foo` is a mount point with UUID `c0e8e20c-4481-4b65-8388-28995906fd7c`, then the fstab file
          in the eystem directory `/!/`imaginarium/` will contain a line like
          `c0e8e20c-4481-4b65-8388-28995906fd7c /:/{dc542bcc-a142-4aaf-b28f-6d4e3aa8bfa2}/ rw`
          referring a hardware storage device with the UUID dc542bcc-a142-4aaf-b28f-6d4e3aa8bfa2
          whose file system will be loaded. see the fstab docs for more details
  - when creating a symbolic link, links  directly to device-relative paths will be converted to a mount point by
      the kernel filesystem drivers before saving
the directory `/!/imaginarium/` exists on every system and contains primary OS binaries, configuration, and logs. the
  layout and contents of `/!/imaginarium/` may vary and should for the most part not be relied on, except as
  specified in the boot protocol docs. system config files, despite being normal files with known format, should
  still be accessed by user code through the configuration APIs in the usermode kernel services for the system
  component being configured.

`/?` is the name of the root object directory, which is held statically by the object manager subsystem
`/!` is an alias for the file-system object `/?/RootFs`
`/*` is an alias for the file-system object `/?/EfiFs` if it exists
`/:/uuid` is an alias for the file-system object `/?/FileSystems/uuid` whose parent device object should be
    `/?/Devices/uuid` (the device may be a pseudo-device for a partition which forwards io to the root disk object)
